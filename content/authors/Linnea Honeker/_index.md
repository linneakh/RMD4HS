Linnea Honeker is currently a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona studying the impact of drought on soil microbial activity in the tropical rainforest biome at Biosphere 2. She utilizes multi-omics, including metabolomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and volatilomics to characterize active microbial metabolic pathways from multiple directions. She is particularly interested in how stress events, such as drought, impact these active microbial pathways, and how this impacts ecosystem functioning and resiliency.
